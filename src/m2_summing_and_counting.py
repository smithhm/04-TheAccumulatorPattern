"""
This module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern in classic forms:
   SUMMING:    total = total + number
   COUNTING:   count = count + 1

A subsequent module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern
in another classic form:
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

Authors: David Mutchler, Vibha Alangar, Matt Boutell, Dave Fisher, Mark Hays,
         Aaron Wilkin, their colleagues, and Haiden Smith.

    #     a test case that your instructor provided in the doc-string)
    #     the CORRECT (EXPECTED) answer for your test case.

    #   Step 4: Write code that prints both the EXPECTED answer
